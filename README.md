These are the code and data files required to generate the figures in the OCT-Bessel stalls paper titled "Capillaries susceptible to frequent stall dynamics revealed by comparing OCT and Bessel-2PM measurements."
Please run code files in MATLAB with the working directory set to the folder containing the .m files.

The original angiograms can be found in DANDI archive #001537, as the files are too large to store on GitHub.
